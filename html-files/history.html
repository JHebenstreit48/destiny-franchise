                In the game you play a character known as a "Guardian". The guardians are basically a near immortal
                being with paracausal powers bestowed on them by a floating AI beings known as Ghosts. The ghosts were
                created by a planet or moon sized entity known by many names. Humanity refers to this entity as "The
                Traveler". However, there are alien species from other planets and solar systems that have other names
                for it. It is not well known what The Traveler actually is. However, via the ghosts your guardian gains
                various paracausal powers and can be continuously revived by its ghost. The first 10 years of this game
                focused around the Light vs. Darkness saga. This means the story focuses around your guardian and the
                other characters it encounters in a decade long story about the war between the forces of The Light
                (sky) and the forces of Darkness (deep).

                known as "The Witness". You also later find out The Witness is not a singular entity. It is an entity
                composed of an entire alien race that was the first species to be touched by The Traveler. However, The
                Traveler eventually left the home world of The Witness. In anger and in a form of retaliation for The
                Traveler abandoning them. The entire species chose to form themselves into one entity that would become
                known as The Witness.
